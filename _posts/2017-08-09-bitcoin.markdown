## Summary
Bitcoin developers are about to implement a "segwit"(Segregated Witness) algorythm into all the bitcoin transactions completely. The main principle of this feature is to remove a sign from every 1MB block of transactions. It can increase the transactions quantity in every block and finally solve the scaling problem, that was a cornerstone of all the disputs, connected with Bitcoin for lst 3 years. Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson has proofs, that because of adoption by institutional investors, elimination of uncertainty in scaling issues and increased legalization of Bitcoin in major economies, Bitcoin can increase his price to 5000$ to the end of 2017.
